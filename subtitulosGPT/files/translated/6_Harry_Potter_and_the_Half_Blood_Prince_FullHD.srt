1
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:25,468
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>

2
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:31,891
<i>He's back.</i>

3
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:58,579
<i>The police are continuing their investigation...</i>

4
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,790
<i>...into the disaster at the Millennium Bridge.</i>

5
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:04,668
<i>Traffic has been stopped while
the police search for survivors.</i>

6
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,504
<i>The area remains closed.</i>

7
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,339
<i>The Mayor has asked Londoners
to remain calm...</i>

8
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,840
<i>...as the investigation continues.</i>

9
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,467
FALLEN FROM GRACE

10
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,011
MRS. AND MR. MALFOY'S SON
AND WIFE LEAVE THE COURT

11
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,430
"Harry Potter".

12
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:18,599
Who's Harry Potter?

13
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:22,144
Nobody.

14
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:24,063
Actually, he's a bit of an idiot.

15
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,234
Funny that newspaper.

16
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,028
I could have sworn I saw a picture move
a few nights ago.

17
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:33,989
- Really?
- I thought I was going mad.

18
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:45,292
- Hey. I was wondering--
- Eleven. That's when I leave.

19
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,254
You can tell me all about
that idiot Harry Potter.

20
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,390
<i>You've been reckless this summer, Harry.</i>

21
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,851
<i>I like to travel by train.</i>

22
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,021
It makes my mind wander.

23
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,441
To not very pleasant things, eh?

24
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,944
The story's exciting,
if I tell it to myself.

25
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,655
But now's not the time
to tell it.

26
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:58,407
Take my arm.
